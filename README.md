# Solutions to "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP)

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP), a classic textbook on programming and computer science by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman.

## Repository Structure

- Each `chapterX.X` directory corresponds to a subchapter X.X of the book and contains files with problem solutions.
- Problems within each directory are organized into separate files or grouped by topic.
- Solutions are implemented in Scheme, the language used extensively in the book for examples and exercises.
